    "# ISTA 322 - A bit of python programming\n",
    " \n",
    "This lesson is just a brief review of some python programming skills. Specifically, this is about how to make functions to either check some specific aspect of the data or extract something from it. As you learned so far, the major goal of data engineering is transforming the data into a more usable format.  Ideally you want to wrap up your transform operations into functions so they can be repeatedly applied to new data or in automated workflows. \n",
    " \n",
    "We're just covering the basics here.  This should be review as you all needed at least one python programming class to be here.  If you're rusty or only have had that one class be sure to take some time here.  If you've taken a bunch of python already you can probably skip this.  "

    "Let's work a bit with bikeshare data.  Many of you have seen this from my other classes, but it's a good dataset for developing various programming and data skills.  \n",
    "\n",
    "One issue in this dataset is that there are outliers.  Riders might have put in improper birthdays, or bikes might have had strange ride times or distances.  You could visualize these features and look for outliers. You could also make functions that go up and count how many values are above or below a certain threshold.  We're going to do the latter to help us practice making functions. "

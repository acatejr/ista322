# HW2 - Transforms!
 
In this homework we'll be practicing some data aggregations, joins, and flattening JSON files in order to make inferences from two datasets!
 
The first file is a dataset with 25,000,000 movie reviews.  These are already in flat files and are clean.  But, we obviously want to do some filtering (e.g. remove movies that only have a review or two).  And we'll want to do a couple of aggregations and joins to distill down those 25 million reviews into something understandable and useable.  
 
The other dataset will have you going to Yelp and making a dev account.  You'll then access various bits of information about local businesses and their reviews in order to figure out which ones are doing the best in Covid times.

## Wranging and aggregating movie review data
 
The website MovieLens.com has a research group which provides open access to millions of reviews, for free!  We're going to work with those data for this homework.  [Feel free to check out the website here.](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)  You can go and download the raw data, but in order to make things a bit easier, the files have been uploaded the Google drive for fast direct downloads.  
 
There are two datasets we'll be working with.
* movies - this is a file of 60,000+ movies
* reviews - this is a file of 25 *million* individual reviews for the 60k movies
 
The goal for this section of the homework is to do two types of data aggregations that will allow for someone to make inferences on which movies were the most popular, reviewed, polarizing and were cult classics.  
 
To do this we'll first start by making a simple data set that brings just overall review properties together with movies.  We'll then do some deeper groupings to create a dataset that looks at the same properties but over time.

### Data first
 
Let's bring in our two files and libraries.  The ratings file is understandably large.  So it's a good idea to download it and then save a copy as something else and work with that.  This way if you mess up you don't have to download it all over again

"""## Convert timestamp in ratings to a datetime. - [1.5 points]
 
One issue that you can see from your exploration is that the ratings only have a timestamp.  This timestamp is measured in the number of seconds since 00:00:00 on January 1st, 1970.  You'll need to convert this to a datetime in order to actually do our later data aggregations.  
 
You use `pd.to_datetime` on timestamps like this.  [For full details on the various ways to use this function please look at the Pandas documentation.](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.to_datetime.html) Briefly, this is how it's used. 
 
```
>>> pd.to_datetime(1490195805, unit='s')
Timestamp('2017-03-22 15:16:45')
```
 
**Task** Make a new column in the movies dataframe called `review_dt` that contains the data from the timestamp column but converted to a datetime datatype.  
 
Note, it's good practice to do this by first assigning the output to a test vector first, rather than directly adding the output to the dataframe. This allows you to make sure your operation did what you wanted before modifying your dataframe. Once you're confident of the output, you can assign the vector to the `reviews` dataframe as a new column. 
 
For example
```
test_vec = pd.to_datetime(arguments)
test_vec # to check what it contains
```
"""

# Make test vector
test_vec = pd.to_datetime(ratings['timestamp'], unit='s')
test_vec

# Check vector and datatype to make sure it make sense.  
test_vec.describe(datetime_is_numeric=True)

# Now ad this to the ratings dataframe
ratings['review_dt'] = test_vec

# Check the head of your dataframe again
ratings.head()

# What's the oldest and newest review?  It should be 1995-01-09 and 2019-11-21, respectively.

The first aggregation and join I want you to do is at the whole movie level.

**Task:** Do the following:
* Create an aggregated dataframe called `ratings_by_movie`. This dataframe should be grouped by movie. Use `.agg()` to calculate the mean, standard deviation ('std'), and the number of reviews for each movie.

Now we want to clean up this dataset a bit and then do a couple more transforms. One issue you can see from your check above is that many movies only have one rating.  We're going to choose to set a minimum number of reviews needed to be included.  We also want to do some binning where movies with certain ratings levels 
 
**Task:** Please do the following operations
* Filter `movies_with_ratings` so it only contains movies that have at least 10 ratings
* Use the function `cut()` to automatically bin our `rating_mean` column into three groups of 'bad', 'fine', or 'good' movies.  Call this `rating_group`.
* Use the same function to take the standard deviation in rating and make three groups of 'agreement', 'average', 'controversial'.  Thus, movies with low standard deviation have agreement in the rating, while movies with high standard deviation have controversy in the ratings.  Call this column `ratings_agreement`.

"""I didn't show you how to use `cut()` in the lesson, but it's a transform just like anything else.  You could use a `np.where()` statement like we did, but `cut()` is a bit easier.  All it does is take 1) a column as the first argument, 2) the number of bins you want to group it in as the second argument, and then 3) the labels you want to give those bins as the third.  It automatically divides them up into equal sized bins. 
 
For example, if I make the following list:
```
rating = [2, 4, 9, 8, 5, 3, 6, 10, 2, 1, 6, 7]
```
 
And run `cut()` on it with three bins and levels 'bad', 'fine', and 'good':
```
pd.cut(rating, 3, labels=['bad', 'fine', 'good'])

I get a return of:
```
[bad, bad, good, good, fine, ..., good, bad, bad, fine, fine]

"""###  Exploring our data 
 
Making bins like this allows us to figure out things like which movies are both bad, but have differing opinions on.  For example, we can filter out movies that are in the bad category but have a lot of controversy about those ratings.  This could mean they're 'cult classic' movies where despite the low rating some people actually really love the movies.  
 
A dataset like this could be used in a recommendation engine where if you see people liking these 'bad but good' movies you could suggest others that meet the came criteria.

## Grouping within years - [3 point]
 
Now that we've done our overall grouping by movie, let's get a bit more detail about these ratings. Specifically, let's engineer a dataset that breaks down the average rating not only by movie, but also by the year the person provided the review.  This would allow for someone to see which movies continue to do well over time, which ones become more popular, and which ones don't age well!
 
**Task:** You're going to do the following steps:
* Create a new `ratings_by_movie` that groups both by `movieId` but also by your `review_dt` column.  I want you to group into year intervals.  
* Join `movies` to `ratings_by_movie` so that you have the summary review statistics for each year the movie has been out
* Clean up and filter your dataframe

First, create `ratings_by_movie`.  You can group by two levels by just adding a list of what levels you want to group by in the `groupby()` statement.  I'll give you some help there, but you have to complete the rest in order to group by movieId first and review_dt second.

For this second part of the assignment we're going to be using the Yelp API via the python package `yelpapi`.  Like with the Spotify API, you need to go get a yelp developer account here: https://www.yelp.com/fusion. 
When you try to create an app, it asks for name, description and contact info. The it gives you clientid and api key. 
 
The goal will be to make a dataset of local taco places that are doing well during Coronavirus. Specifically, we want to make a dataset that takes their average score since they've been open and compares it to the average score of the last three reviews.  Shops that have been doing well should hopefully have these two averages be similar. 
 
There will be three main steps to this process:
 
* First you'll search by location type and get aggregate information for everything that falls in the ice cream category.
* Second you'll get reviews for all those locations.  Yelp only returns three reviews when you call an ID, but that still works. Given you can only query one ID at a time, you'll need to write a loop to create a dataframe of all the reviews.  
* Third, you'll aggregate the latest review information to see how their average review score compares to their overall average review score.
